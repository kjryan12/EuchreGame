# EuchreGame
This is a work in progress of a two player euchre game.

What I have so far:
    - A deck that contains the cards 9 - Ace of every suit.
    - A initialization of the trump suit and reassignment of point values to reflect the jack values after the call.
    - A function to show the player his/her hand and table cards.
What I want to add:
    - The actual play of the game. Should contain istanceof method calls to tell player which suit is necessary to play.
    - Should contain way to transfer the lead to the player who won the last hand.
    - A hand counter to keep track of points.
    - A way of visualizing your hand.
    - A way of randomly pulling a jack from the deck to determine dealer.
